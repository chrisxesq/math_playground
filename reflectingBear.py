# having built it out of an orthonormal basis set E that you create from Bear's Basis
# and a transformation matrix in the mirror's coordinates TE.

    # Use the gsBasis function on bearBasis to get the mirror's orthonormal basis.
    E = gsBasis(bearBasis)
    # Write a matrix in component form that performs the mirror's reflection in the mirror's basis.
    # Recall, the mirror operates by negating the last component of a vector.
    # Replace a,b,c,d with appropriate values

    # Finally, we return the result. There is no need to change this line.
